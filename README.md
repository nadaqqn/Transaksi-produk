# 🛒 E-Commerce Checkout Simulation Website

Hello! 👋  
This repository contains a simple simulation of an e-commerce shopping experience — from browsing products to generating a unique transaction code via hashing! 🔐🧾

---

## 🧭 Features

This project was built to simulate the **core flow** of a basic e-commerce system. Here’s what’s included:

- 🛍️ **Product Showcase** – A clean and interactive product list.
- ➕ **Add to Cart** – Click and add products to your shopping cart.
- ✅ **Checkout Process** – Finalize the transaction with one click.
- 🔐 **Transaction Hashing** – After checkout, a unique hash code is automatically generated to represent the transaction.
- 🗃️ **Transaction Logging** – All completed checkouts are recorded for tracking purposes.
